        <h3>Browser</h3>
        <p>An application which allows users to fetch and view websites. Behind the scenes, this is achieved by looking up domain names on the DNS system, connecting to a server, downloading requested web content (code files) from the server, and rendering it into a viewable website.</p>

        <h3>DNS</h3>
        <p>The internet's system for matching a human-readable domain name typed into a browser to the numeric IP Address of a server, where a given website's files are stored.</p>

        <h3>Domain Name</h3>
        <p>The human-friendly address of a website; the address that is typed into the browser. The browser sends this address to DNS in order to be forwarded to the appropriate server at the IP address associated with the domain name. An example of a domain name is <code>Donutshop.com</code>.</p>

        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>Web pages that change their layout or other styles based on the media (screen size, orientation, device type) on which it is displayed. Makes use of media queries in CSS to define how and in what context specific CSS should be used.</p>

        <h3>Semantic Code</h3>
        <p>Refers to HTML code which properly utilizes elements according to their meaning. It is code that describes the content rather than using elements simply based on their appearance.</p>

        <h3>Server</h3>
        <p>A specialized computer that stores website files and content and makes them accessible on the internet.</p>

        <h3>Viewport</h3>
        <p>The visible area of a web page in a browser window. Viewport dimensions vary with different device screen sizes, orientation, and window scaling.</p>

      <h3>Element</h3>
      <p>A discrete piece of code in HTML that defines specific content, such as text, media, etcetera. An element typically includes an opening tag, and may include attributes, and a closing tag (if it is not a self-closing element).</p>

      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>An abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language. It is the most basic language for websites and defines the meaning and structure of content on a web page.</p>

      <h3>Self-Closing Element</h3>
      <p>Any element that does not require a separate closing tag in addition to the opening tag. For example: <img src=""> which stands alone, as opposed to <strong>text</strong>, which requires the closing tag after the text.<code>house.jpg</code></p>

      <h3>Tag</h3>
      <p>The written code associated with an element. Usually consists of the name of the element (or sometime an abbreviation) placed between arrow brackets, e.g. <code>Lorem Ipsum</code></p>

      <h3>Declaration / Rule</h3>
      <p>A property / value pair that defines the style for one aspect of the selected element. E.g. <code>padding: 2rem</code>, where padding is the property and 2rem is the value.</p>

      <h3>Declaration Block</h3>
      <p>A chunk of CSS that includes one or more selectors associated with one or more rules (property / value pairs).</p>

      <h3>Property</h3>
      <p>Identifies which feature a CSS declaration will affect. A property is paired with a valid value to declare that a specific style should be used. Together, the property / value pair are called a rule or declaration. Examples of properties might include: <code>color: maroon; font-size: 1.1em; or margin: 20px;</code></p>

      <h3>Selector</h3>
      <p>Indicates the particular HTML content to be styled by a given CSS declaration block. Can a be a type of element, a class or ID, or various other more complex methods of identifying particular HTML.</p>

      <h3>Stylesheet</h3>
      <p>Another word for the CSS file associated with a web page. Here is one way to configure the link: <code>link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" media="screen"</code></p>

      <h3>Value</h3>
      <p>The specified setting for a given CSS property in a declaration. Each property has its own set of associated valid values. Depending on the property, a value might be numeric (400), a measurement (5px), a color (#efefef), a keyword (italic), etcetera.</p>
